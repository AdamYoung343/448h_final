define bezier curves
define objects
define distribution of objects along a curve
	spacing/number of objects to determine position
	orientation of objects
	scale of objects
	randomness for any of these values
	function to define varying values of these parameters along the curve
define volumetric distributions of objects
treat curves as an object which can be placed on a curve

3 base objects:
volumes (rectangular prisms or elipsoids) with varying distribution
curves with parameters defined above
objects (default? or loaded from a file)

specify materials for objects, input a string which will describe the material and indicate what objects to apply it to
maybe add lights? or maybe have users go back and add them to the pbrt file

output: a pbrt file describing the objects in the scene
